*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Zendesk component provides access to all of the zendesk.com APIs accessible
using https://github.com/cloudbees/zendesk-java-client[zendesk-java-client]. It
allows producing messages to manage Zendesk ticket, user, organization, etc.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-zendesk</artifactId>
        <version>${camel-version}</version>
    </dependency>

== Zendesk Options

// component options: START
The Zendesk component supports 10 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *serverUrl* (common) | The server URL to connect. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | Component configuration |  | ZendeskConfiguration
| *zendesk* (advanced) | To use a shared Zendesk instance. |  | Zendesk
| *oauthToken* (security) | The OAuth token. |  | String
| *password* (security) | The password. |  | String
| *token* (security) | The security token. |  | String
| *username* (security) | The user name. |  | String

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *inBody* (common) | Sets the name of a parameter to be passed in the exchange In Body |  | String
| *serverUrl* (common) | The server URL to connect. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: in-only, in-out, in-optional-out |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long

| *scheduledExecutorService* (scheduler) | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. |  | ScheduledExecutorService
| *scheduler* (scheduler) | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. Use value spring or quartz for built in scheduler | none | Object
| *schedulerProperties* (scheduler) | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. |  | Map
| *startScheduler* (scheduler) | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | boolean
| *timeUnit* (scheduler) | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. There are 7 enums and the value can be one of: nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days | milliseconds | TimeUnit
| *useFixedDelay* (scheduler) | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | boolean
| *oauthToken* (security) | The OAuth token. |  | String
| *password* (security) | The password. |  | String
| *token* (security) | The security token. |  | String
| *username* (security) | The user name. |  | String

// endpoint options: END



== Producer Endpoints:

Producer endpoints can use endpoint names and associated options described next. 


== Consumer Endpoints:

Any of the producer endpoints can be used as a consumer endpoint.
Consumer endpoints can use
http://camel.apache.org/polling-consumer.html#PollingConsumer-ScheduledPollConsumerOptions[Scheduled
Poll Consumer Options] to schedule endpoint invocation.
Consumer endpoints that return an array or collection will
generate one exchange per element, and their routes will be executed
once for each exchange.


== Message header

Any of the options can be provided in a message header for producer
endpoints with *CamelZendesk.* prefix. In principal, parameter names are same as
the arugument name of each API methods on the original `org.zendesk.client.v2.Zendesk`
 class. However some of them are renamed to the other name to avoid confliction in the
 camel API component framework. To see actual parameter name, please check `org.apache.camel.component.zendesk.internal.ZendeskApiMethod`.
 

== Message body

All result message bodies utilize objects provided by the Zendesk Java Client.
Producer endpoints can specify the option name for incoming message body
in the *inBody* endpoint parameter.
